                Bulls and cows is a traditional game in which you have to guess pre-generated combination of numbers.
                The program generates combination of 4 unique numbers (the same number can't be in more than one place at a time,  zero is included). After you start the game, you must try to guess the combination, result will be presented in the form of number of bulls and cows.
                Bull means that you guessed the number and the corresponding position. Cows mean that you only guessed the number, but it’s not in the correct position.
                The game ends when you guess all numbers and their positions, which is equal to 4 bulls.
                If you decide to surrender, you can choose “Give Up” where you will see what was the combination.
                Have fun!
